1. Write a program called `name.rb` that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

2. Write a program called  `age.rb` that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.


        output of age.rb for someone 20 yrs old`
        How old are you?
        In 10 years you will be:
        30
        In 20 years you will be:
        40
        In 30 years you will be:
        50
        In 40 years you will be:
        60
3. Add another section onto `name.rb` that prints the name of the `user 10 times`. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. `Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly`.
4. Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

<h2>Methods</h2>
1. Write a program that prints a greeting message. This program should contain a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter and returns a string.
